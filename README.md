The repository contains all files that used to build the [DEMI Official Website](https://demi-research.github.io).

Our website is built using the Hugo framework and leverages the ["Research Group"](https://hugoblox.com/templates/details/research-group/) theme from Hugo Blox.

**The website is made and maintained mainly by [@TianJ9](https://github.com/TianJ9).**

Thanks for your visit and look forward to your joining us!
